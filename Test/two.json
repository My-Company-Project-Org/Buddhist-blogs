      '<p>Holes have been formed parallel to the places where there are bumps. I wondered how these holes were formed, only to look at them, I realized that these holes are formed by the drop of water falling.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Even if I brought water for two years and watered this rock with buckets of water for a whole day, I could not do any damage to that rock.</p>\n' +

Electric discharges go here and there between your neurons. All the things you see, hear, do, taste, smell and imagine are all. Things happen.</p>\n" +

      `<p><em>"Ralph Waldo Emerson"</em> said a very important saying: <strong>"Plant a 
thought, and you will reap an action. Plant an action, and you will reap a habit. Plant 
a habit, and you will reap a character."</strong> You plant a character trait and you reap a destiny." It means how can we change our life path. It starts with a thought and we develop it into an action. Repeat the action and improve it as a habit. By repeating that habit, it becomes a characteristic of our character, and when we repeat it, it changes into a destiny. That's what it means</p>\n` +
      '<p>If we want to improve something, we have to improve every aspect. As each section is developed, when they are integrated, a great improvement is obtained.</p>\n' +

      "<p>A man named Michael is losing back to back in his weightlifting competitions so he decides to change his coach. His new coach changes everything about Michael's competition. Every aspect was improved, such as the clothes he wears, the shoes he wears, and the place he trains, etc., thus improving things and training for several years, Michael won several consecutive victories in weightlifting competitions. Finally, this person 
named Michael got the opportunity to participate in the Olympic Games. In the olympic games, this man named Michael achieved several outdoor victories in weightlifting competitions.</p>\n" +

Then how does this happen and how do we get rid of this are the issues that we are talking about. <strong>The first one has internal friction.&nbsp;</strong>Actually, inner conflict can happen under 03 parts, it can be mental, it can be spiritual or it can be with some feeling. Let's 
talk about how to be mentally</p>\n" +
      "<p>Let's say we want to make $100,000. We have developed the business and worked 
as hard as you did before.<br>Then the work is carried out with fear and sadness because of the doubt that the same thing will happen again when the work is done again. Then they catch up. For a while, the feeling of having a memory starts to come more and the motivation is lost. Because of the fear and doubt that this will happen again.</p>\n" +

      "<p>There is a strong feeling on the negative side, which means that while doing this work, I will not get this, or I am not worthy, I am not talented, I have a feeling that someone else is more talented than this. But the work is going on. You can continue 
for a while, then you get bored and lose the motivation to continue the work<br>We did this degree and now we have done the master's degree, but now it is not clear to me that 
this is not the path I want to take.</p>\n" +
      '<p>Example There was a friend of mine who graduated from the same university with me and was working as an engineer with a good salary in a well-recognized company. He got tired of that job and left that job and moved to another field of work as a bus driver which he likes.</p>\n' +

      "<p>Example - michael phelps This person is an olympic award winner in various fields. This person's height is about six and four. He was involved in both basketball and 
swimming. But this person's body was designed to play basketball, but with the help of his trainers and the technology available in America, his anatomy has been made in such a way that it is easy to swim very fast. This person left the basketball game under the knowledge of the coaches and continued to practice swimming.<br>Finally, this person won 
consecutive awards in swimming competitions at the olympic events.<br>He was able to get consecutive awards because he chose the best.<br>If they find the right setting for them, all such people can become experts, become great, collect a lot of money, become famous, and think that they are doing great things.</p>\n" +

      '<p>Example - If you are thinking of spreading some product all over the country, 
see how to spread it all over the world</p>\n' +
      '<p>Always try to increase the standards, then the motivation together will start 
to come. Discipline of those who set standards very high does not fall easily. Such people cannot be knocked down easily.</p>\n' +
      '<p>What kind of environment are you in? To develop self-confidence, to develop discipline, to develop energy, to develop talent for certain things, you need to develop in that environment.<br>I am not going to talk about it at length.</p>\n' +
      '<p>When we do some work, there is a way that the neurohormones etc. in our body work. We have to train our body to do something and then there is a problem. If we have any addiction, it becomes difficult to do it.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Example - If you use a drug, if you are addicted to playing video games, 10, 12 hours</p>\n' +

dopamine it needs to work the neurology it needs. Therefore, addictions have to be eliminated</p>\n' +
